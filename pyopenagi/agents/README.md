# openagi/src/agents
This folder contains the base implementation for running the agents, as well as the handlers for running multiple agents in Threads in `agent_process.py` and `agent_factory.py`

In `native_agents/` we have the 6 default agents.
In `agent_config/` we have their respective configurations.
